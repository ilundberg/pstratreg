Title: Estimate Bounds via Principal Stratification
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ian Lundberg and Soonhong Cho
Maintainer: Ian Lundberg <ilundberg@cornell.edu>
Description: When studying the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome, post-treatment events may render the outcome undefined. For example, the effect of job training on hourly wage is ill-defined for  those who would not be employed without job training. This package estimates average causal effects among those whose outcome would be defined regardless of the intervention, producing a set-identified result.
